n = 8:
  There are 92 solutions out of 15,720 considered to find a valid
  solutions with nqueen2.

n = 10
  There are 724 solutions out of 348,150 considered to find a valid
  solution with nqueen2.

- In your own words, what is the benefit of a recursive solution to
enumerate all of the nqueens potential solutions

It can be beneficial to enumerate all possible solutions in a problem where you 
are trying to find subsets of a given set of data. Also, it can be helpful for 
traversing a tree data structure. 

- Also in your own words, what are the theoretical and/or practical
advantages of constraining the search space to only still valid 
solutions?

By restraining the search space to only valid solutions increases efficiency 
of the program. Also, if this was a program that the valid solutions needed to 
be stored in a data structure this would decrease the amount of memory that would
be used.
